# Ticket booking system

Project to create a program that interactively lets the user interface to order tickets to a Monty Python Q & A session.
- Shows the user the number of tickets left available to buy, so they can understand the importance of buying now.
- Is interactive: asks the users name and utilises knowledge of that name in the output statements so as to make the user feel welcomed by the brand.
- Reports errors in a user-friendly manner, so that they can understand what they’ve inputted wrong (what is causing the program to fail) and adapt their approach for next time.
- The user can request a certain number of tickets and be told the total cost to decide whether to proceed. #
- The user is then asked if they would like to proceed with the purchase now that they know the cost, and to confirm that they have the correct number of tickets.
- The user is not offered tickets if there aren’t any (or enough) available. 
- The provider has asked for a transaction fee to be added to each single transaction to maintain the upkeep of the software. This is incorporated in the total cost output and provided to the user.
